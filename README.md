# Working-Master-Garage-Sale
After many starts and stops and working through the Academind course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Web Development" including the major project in building an online shop, I am now going to begin the process of developing an inter-active web site using Node.Js, MongoDB and a number of other services and API.
The base code is the same as developed in the online shop, the primary difference will be to sub-divid the products into categories instead of one group.  Then, I plan to add inventory control limiting adding to the cart to on hand defined quantities and a final feature being the ability to make an offer to buy at a different price.  When offer is acceptable product would be added to cart. Last of all will linking to a payment API such as Square.
